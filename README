libfe310 - C Library for the SiFive FE310 SoC
=============================================
libfe310 is a minimal C library for the SiFive FE310 SoC, providing both
low-level register access and high-level helper functions for peripheral
configuration, control and interrupt handling, with no dependencies, not
even to the C standard library.

Requirements
------------
To build libfe310, you need a working RISC-V toolchain with GCC or Clang
that supports the rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei architecture.

Installation
------------
1. Run `./configure' to customize the settings for your environment.
2. Build and install the library with the following command:
    make install

Use `./configure -h` for available options and defaults.

Usage
-----
To use libfe310, link with `-lfe310` and include headers like this:
    #include <fe310/gpio.h>
    #include <fe310/spi.h>

If installed to a custom path, add the following flags to your compiler:
    -I/path/to/fe310/include
    -L/path/to/fe310/lib
